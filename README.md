# Linux-BlackPad
My Lenovo linux settings, Awesome configs and such, ofcourse all the public stuff like wallpapers, layout settings and wpa passwords... wait, no, I hope not that last part :D

## Log
Removed some folders and unused scripts
Changed the scripts to how they are now.


##  Added ignore list 
So I whitelist the files that need updating :D (there is probably 100 other better ways to do this... why do I even care to share my configs?)

# Usage
Ive decided to git clone this directory in the projects folder and manualy symlink folders to where they belong and files to their recpectable places, to make it more easely maintainable without breaking other git folders I have.

```
$ mkdir Projects
$ cd ~/Projects
$ git clone git@github.com:CodeAsm/Linux-BlackPad.git
$ ln -s /home/codeasm/Projects/Linux-BlackPad/scripts/ scripts
```

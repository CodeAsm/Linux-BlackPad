# Linux-BlackPad
My Lenovo linux settings, Awesome configs and such, ofcourse all the public stuff like wallpapers, layout settings and wpa passwords... wait, no, I hope not that last part :D

## Added log
What more to say?

##  Added ignore list 
So I whitelist the files that need updating :D (there is probably 100 other better ways to do this... why do I even care to share my configs?)
